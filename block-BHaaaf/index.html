    <p id="const">  the Solar System is about 4.6 billion years old. </p>
    <p > It formed by gravity in a large molecular cloud.</p>
    <p> Most of this matter gathered in the center, and the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System.</p>
    <p> It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.</p>
